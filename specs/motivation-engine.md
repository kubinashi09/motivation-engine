# Motivation Engine Concept

*Note: This is a theoretical approach to decision-making in the proposed system. None of this has been implemented or verified.*

## Core Design Ideas

### Weight Parameters (Proposed)
The core might use adjustable weights to balance different priorities:

```
W_intent: How much to prioritize user's stated goals (0.0-1.0)
W_novelty: How much to value exploring new information (0.0-1.0) 
W_cost: How much to avoid expensive operations (0.0-1.0)
```

### Decision Scoring Concept
A simple scoring function could help choose between different actions:

```
Action Score(A) = W_intent × S_intent(A) + W_novelty × S_novelty(A) - W_cost × C_cost(A)
```

This is just math notation for "weigh the pros and cons based on what the user seems to want."

### Learning Approach (Theoretical)
The system might learn from user feedback using:
- **Base approach**: Some form of reinforcement learning 
- **Feedback**: Simple thumbs up/down or implicit satisfaction signals
- **Update strategy**: Gradually adjust weights based on what works
- **Starting point**: Begin with balanced weights and adapt over time

## Implementation Possibilities

### Minimum Viable Approach
A first version might aim for:
- **Model size**: Something small enough to run locally (exact size TBD)
- **Memory usage**: Whatever a typical laptop can handle comfortably
- **Processing**: CPU-based to avoid GPU requirements  
- **Response time**: Fast enough that users don't notice delays

### Plugin Communication Ideas
External tools could receive structured requests like:
```json
{
  "action_type": "search|generate|confirm|analyze",
  "target": "what to work on",
  "context": "relevant background info",
  "priority": "how urgent this is"
}
```

### Feedback Collection
The system might track:
```json
{
  "action_id": "unique identifier for this decision",
  "user_satisfaction": "positive|negative|neutral",
  "timestamp": "when this happened",
  "context": "what was going on"
}
```

## Safety Considerations

### Avoiding Bad Behaviors
- **Multiple objectives**: Don't optimize for just one thing (which can lead to gaming)
- **Gradual changes**: Don't let the system change dramatically overnight
- **Conservative defaults**: When uncertain, choose safer options

### Transparency Ideas  
- **Decision logging**: Keep track of why choices were made
- **Weight tracking**: Show how preferences evolve over time
- **Audit trails**: Make it possible to understand what happened

## Open Questions

- How complex does the decision-making actually need to be?
- Can simple heuristics work as well as machine learning?
- What's the minimum amount of user feedback needed to be useful?
- How do you prevent the system from developing weird behaviors?

## Reality Check

This is all theoretical. The actual implementation might be completely different, simpler, or more complex depending on what actually works in practice. The goal is just to sketch out one possible approach to the "local core makes decisions" part of the system.
